        <p>Javascript is a programming language (for computational or mathematical task or communicate with a system)</p>
        <p>Javascript is known as <b>scripting language</b> (language that runs on browser).</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">History</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Earlier the Javascript was known as <b>ecmascript</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                This language was introduced in the year <b>1995</b> by <b>Brendan Eich</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Initially it was made for netscape browser.
            </li>
            <li>
                It was made in only 12-16 days and includes a lot of bugs initially.
            </li>
            <li>
                In 1996 the internet explorer makes its own ecmascript.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Ecma international</b>- An organization which sets the protocols for the online communication. (<i>orders to merge both the ecmascript and make the final output which works on every browser</i>)
            </li>
            <li>
                Javascript is a <b>backward language</b> (Its previous bugs were not removed instead new function or features add to enhance the language).
            </li>
            <li>
                On the other hand the <b>forward language</b> removes the previous bugs and improves itself in the next version like java.
            </li>
            <li>Google introduced the runtime environment called <b>node.js</b> (It runs the javascript in the system). <b>Node.js = v8 engine (from chrome) + extra features</b></li>
            <li>There are other runtime environment as well like deno.js, bun.js.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="explain">
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Step for node.js</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Step 1:</b> Open chrome and search downlaod node.js</li>
            <li><b>Step 2:</b> Download the LTS (long term support) version from prebuilt binaries.</li>
            <li><b>Step 3:</b> Go to cmd and type <b>node -v</b> or <b>node --version</b></li>
